"""AgenticReplayStrategy - trajectory-driven trace replay timing strategy.

Phase-aware timing strategy for the ``agentic_replay`` timing mode (spec §4.2).

Each trajectory is a wall-clock snapshot of a trace at a sampled instant t*
(by default 25-75% through the trace's recorded duration; the range is
configurable via ``trajectory_start_{min,max}_ratio`` and the
inferencex-agentx-mvp scenario widens it to 0-100%). Every stream (root + each
subagent chain) splits at t*: turns before t* are history, turns at/after t*
are profiled.

WARMUP: for every session active (mid-flight) at t*, replay its last request
before t* (turn ``next_turn_index - 1``) as a session start. The chat prefix
is rebuilt worker-side by ``UserSession.advance_turn``, and what it reproduces
is context-mode dependent: under ``DELTAS_WITH_RESPONSES`` (the weka mode)
it back-seeds the earlier turns so the warmup request carries the full prefix
and primes the server cache to the stream's state at t*; under
``DELTAS_WITHOUT_RESPONSES`` the prior turns are not seeded (live responses
aren't captured yet), so only that turn's delta is sent and the t* prefix is
not reproduced. This includes parents gated on a child join (they sent turn
n-1 before t* and resume at the join turn during PROFILING, so n-1 warms that
turn). Streams whose first request is at/after t* (``next_turn_index == 0``)
have nothing to warm. By default the priming
requests are SPREAD -- aligned globally on t* so every trajectory's t* lands
at the warmup end (see ``_execute_warmup``); ``--burst-phase-starts`` fires
them all at once instead. The phase exits via the standard
``SendingCompleteStopCondition`` plus ``grace_period_sec=inf`` semantics
already in CreditPhaseConfig (count-driven: every turn-n-1 must return).

Warmup-failure accumulation: terminal failures (``credit_return.error`` or
``credit_return.cancelled``) on a WARMUP credit's final turn are routed by
``CreditCallbackHandler`` into ``record_warmup_failure(trace_id)``. At
WARMUP teardown, ``PhaseRunner`` calls ``report_warmup_failures()`` which
raises ``TrajectoryWarmupFailedError`` if any failures were recorded. This
aborts PROFILING so steady-state metrics aren't silently biased by a
degraded trajectory pool.

PROFILING: each stream resumes at its first turn at/after t*
(``next_turn_index``). Default dispatch preserves the stream's recorded offset
from the replay boundary; ``--burst-phase-starts`` collapses each lane's first
eligible request to profiling-time 0. Accelerated cache warmup synthesizes a
new replay boundary at the warmup handoff and carries each live stream's
residual next-turn delay into profiling, so the handoff ramps instead of
firing every live stream at once. Subsequent turns honor trace inter-turn
``delay_ms`` from the original trace timeline. Gated parents fire their
join turn when blocking children complete. When a root session reaches its
final turn AND its whole tree (root + every descendant subagent) has drained,
its lane recycles: a fresh session (starting at turn 0) is spawned from the
next root drawn from the shared dataset sampler
(``TrajectorySource.next_recycle_conversation_id``), honoring the configured
``sampling_strategy`` -- there is no strategy-side FIFO recycle queue.

OPEN-LOOP PROFILING (``--session-arrival-rate``): the lane/recycle model above
is replaced by an exogenous session-arrival process (see
:mod:`aiperf.timing.session_arrival`). There are no trajectories and no t*
snapshot warmup: every arrival admits a fresh trace replay from turn 0, and a
drained tree recycles nothing. In-system session count becomes a consequence of
the arrival rate and per-session residence time rather than a configured
constant. Everything downstream of admission -- continuations at
``completion(turn k) + recorded delay``, subagent fan-out, inner turns -- is
unchanged and is never metered by the arrival rate.
