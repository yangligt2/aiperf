"""Trajectory conversation source for the AgenticReplay timing strategy.

Builds a fixed set of trajectories at construction time so trajectory state
survives the WARMUP -> PROFILING boundary. Timestamped traces are sampled as
wall-clock snapshots: choose a ``t*`` inside the configured percent range,
then reconstruct the conversations that are alive at that instant (root and
subagents). Legacy timestamp-less datasets fall back to the original
``(trace_id, start_turn_index)`` split.

"Trajectory" matches the aa-agent-perf vocabulary and standard agentic-AI / RL
terminology for one rollout-style sequence of turns. Avoids conflating with
aiperf's existing ``User`` class in ``user_centric_rate.py``.

        """Sample one trajectory per concurrency lane straight from the sampler.

        The dataset sampler alone decides trace selection and repetition (it
        wraps: sequential round-robin, shuffle, or random-with-replacement), so
        when concurrency exceeds the pool the same trace recurs across lanes --
        no separate wrap-fill step. Each lane snapshots its trace independently
        (per-lane t*), so repeated traces resume at different points.

        Unspawnable samples (missing metadata / too few turns / no valid
        warmup-profile split) are skipped and the sampler is asked again. The
        attempt budget bounds the skip loop so an all-unspawnable pool can't
        spin; it yields fewer than ``concurrency`` lanes only when the pool has
        too few spawnable traces.
